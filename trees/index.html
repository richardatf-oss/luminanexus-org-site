              “Tree” is a way the one Field shows a different face: origin,
              stone, mirrors, snow, water, fire, song, and more. Some are active
              projects, some are sefarim-in-waiting, all are branches of one
              living Etz Chaim.

            In Kabbalah, <em>Etz Chaim</em> — the Tree of Life — is not just a
            diagram. It is a way of seeing reality: one living Field expressing
            through ten sefirot, twenty-two letters, and countless paths
            between. The Quantum Etz Chaim takes that image and lets it grow
            into stories, sefarim, learning tools, and sanctuaries.

                At the center is the Quantum Etz Chaim itself: a way of seeing
                reality as one Field, tilted into many modes. The trunk is the
                shared kavanah: that Torah, creativity, and technology can all
                be different ways of touching the same light.

                Each named Tree is also a Sefer or cluster of Sefarim: long-form
                work that walks through one face of the Field. They live in the
                Library as books, and in Projects as experiments, apps, or
                sanctuaries.

                Between any two Trees there are “Gates”: pairings of letters,
                sefirot, and ideas. Over time, the 231 Gates project will map
                these connections as a clickable star-field — a way to wander
                between branches without leaving the Tree.
