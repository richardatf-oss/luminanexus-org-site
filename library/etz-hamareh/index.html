          <h2>The Tree that lives in the glass</h2>
          <p>
            Etz HaMar’ah began with a simple insight: if you stand before a
            mirror and raise your left hand, the image raises its right. The
            “harsh” left side of the Etz Chaim may, in reflection, be a secret
            form of kindness. Judgment becomes protection, boundaries become
            shelter, and what we call darkness sometimes turns out to be
            mercy seen from the wrong side of the glass.
          </p>
        </div>

        <article class="card">
          <p>
            This Tree is a meditation on mirrors: bathroom mirrors, shop
            windows at night, black phone screens, and the invisible inward
            mirrors where we rehearse every shame. It is also a study of
            how a life looks from the inside versus how it looks to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Quantum Etz Chaim frame, Etz HaMar’ah explores what happens
            when the one Field “copies” itself with a slight inversion. Every
            gate, every branch, has a mirrored counterpart. Some are distorted
            (like carnival mirrors). Some are clarifying. The work of this
            Sefer is to tell stories and offer frameworks where the mirror
            becomes not a trap, but a tool for teshuvah.

              The halachic and kabbalistic “left side” (Gevurah, Din) versus
              the “right side” (Chesed). In the mirror, they swap. What does
              that mean for how we see discipline, boundaries, and the
              left-handed among us?

              A core idea: the same impulse that can wreck a life in one
              direction can build a world in another. The Mirror Tree wants
              to show how redirected desire becomes mitzvah, not by erasing
              the past but by reflecting it.

            <p>
              How we see ourselves is often harsher than how HaShem sees us.
              The Tree of Mirrors listens to those inner reflections—anxiety,
              shame, intrusive thoughts—and slowly introduces another view:
              “This, too, can be reflected into kindness.”

              In some scenes, the Tree of Mirrors is literally a reflected
              Etz Chaim: the left-hand column now appears on the right. In
              others, it is a shattered mirror that must be reassembled,
              piece by glittering piece.

              Reflection becomes a way to bless what once felt like a flaw.

              On the quantum side: symmetry, parity, and what happens when
              the laws of physics are mirrored. The Sefer can use these
              ideas gently—as metaphors that hint at deeper symmetries in
              the soul.

            The mirror over the sink had never liked him.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not that it distorted—on the contrary, it was too honest.
            In the flat, indifferent glass he met a man whose left hand had
            built its own religion of reaching for the wrong things. The
            right hand held the toothbrush; the left remembered every bottle,
            every door he should not have opened, every face that had watched
            him slip away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most mornings he could ignore it. Splash of water, eyes half shut,
            the world still mercifully blurred. But there were days when the
            mirror seemed to lean closer, as though the silver backing had
            thinned and something on the other side was trying, gently, to
            get his attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What if</em>, the not-quite-voice asked, <em>you are not seeing
            yourself at all? What if you have only ever seen a reversal?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            He raised his left hand experimentally. The man in the mirror
            raised his right, and somewhere deep in the architecture of the
            Tree, a column that had always been called “severity” shifted,
            just a little, toward mercy.
