          <h2>The stone that became a Tree</h2>
          <p>
            The Stone Tree begins with a real stone: a piece of petrified wood
            found by your son Matthew. Something about its ridges, weight, and
            quiet age refused to leave the imagination. It felt less like an
            object and more like a witness—an ancient trunk that had traded
            sap for quartz and stood there, waiting to be read.
          </p>
        </div>

        <article class="card">
          <p>
            Etz HaEven asks: what happens when a life, a family, or even a
            whole world “turns to stone”? Is it dead—and therefore beyond
            change—or has it simply moved into a slower language of
            transformation?
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel follows a protagonist who discovers a Stone Tree and
            begins to hear stories in its rings. Each ring holds a different
            lifetime of failure, teshuvah, addiction, love, exile, and return.
            The style leans toward a gothic, Poe-tinged voice—shadowed, dense,
            and musical—while still rooted in hope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underneath the prose is a field-theory of memory: the idea that
            nothing is truly lost, only compressed. Stone is what happens when
            light refuses to let go of a story.

              prayers, and silences does it take to become stone? Can a heart

              The Stone Tree holds stories of addiction, shame, and the long
              walk back. Not as spectacle, but as geology: strata of choice
              and consequence that can still be walked, layer by layer.

            <h3>Kabbalah of stone</h3>
            <p>
              Even as a symbol of malchut and heaviness; the Luchot as divine
              writing sunk into sapphire; the “heart of stone” that prophets
              promise will become a “heart of flesh.” Etz HaEven asks what it
              means for letters to live inside rock.

              Quantum Etz Chaim imagery runs beneath the surface: the same
              living Field that moves in waving branches also condenses into
              stone. Nothing is separate; it’s all one Tree moving through
              different speeds of time.

            <h3>Style &amp; atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
              A hybrid of literary, mystical, and gothic tones: think
              “Poe walks through a desert wash with a piece of fossilized
              wood and a book of midrash.” The Stone Tree is meant to be
              immersive, heavy, and strangely consoling.

            Long, parallel ridges—straight as memory, tight as a whisper frozen in place—
            ran the length of the stone. What had once been sap and bark and branch
            now lay in his palm as a cooled flame, a quiet geometry of years pressed
            too close together to name. 
          </p>
          <p>
            He turned it once, twice, as one might turn a question over on the tongue.
            In the angled late-afternoon light of the wash, the fossil did not simply
            shine; it seemed to remember. There, in the fine crosshatch of mineral and
            grain, he felt the faintest pressure of other lives: nights that would not
            end, days bled out on motel carpets, the slow petrifying of a heart that
            had once sworn it would never grow hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he listened long enough, he was certain the stone would speak. Not in
            thunder, not in prophecy, but in the dry, patient cadence of rings stacked
            upon rings: <em>I was wood once. I carried water. I bent in the wind. What
            you call “stone” is only what happens when a story refuses to die.</em>
