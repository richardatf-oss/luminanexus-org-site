          <p>
            In the beginning of this book, there is no tree. No branches, no
            leaves glistening with dew, no roots tunneling into dark soil.
            There is only One: הָאֵין סוֹף, the endless, the field before every
            field. Modern physics stumbles toward this in its own language,
            speaking of unified fields and vacuum states. Kabbalah speaks of Ein
            Sof, a life so whole that “inside” and “outside” have not yet been
            imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Sefer is not a physics textbook and not a technical kabbalistic
            manual. It is a guided walk through the hunch that both are
            circling: that reality is one living Field which knows how to appear
            as many.

            Aleph as the first almost-sound: the space that lets words be

              Aleph as the white fire behind the letters: Ein Sof as an
              unbroken, ever-present field in which all phenomena arise. In
              parallel, the ground state of quantum fields and the “vacuum”
              that is never truly empty.

            <h3>Aleph as Tilt</h3>
            <p>
              The first inclination within the Field: tzimtzum as a contemplative
              picture of symmetry breaking, a subtle leaning that allows
              distinction without severance.

            <h3>Aleph as Bridge</h3>
            <p>
              The written form of Aleph as upper point, lower point, and
              diagonal: keter and malchut in conversation, direct and returning
              light, the way the Infinite and the finite speak through each
              other in every moment.

          <h3>Excerpt from Chapter Aleph</h3>
          <!-- You can replace this with the full expanded sections we wrote -->
          <p>
            Imagine absolute darkness—not the darkness of a room where a switch
            could be flipped, but a darkness in which “light” and “dark” have
            never yet been conceived. No up, no down, no before or after. Only a
            fullness so complete that there is no edge to mark it. If such a
            fullness could have an inner gesture, the sages call it <em>ratzon</em>:
            will, not from lack but from overflowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this will, a first tilt arises. The Infinite does not move
            from here to there; rather, it allows a tiny asymmetry, a place for
            a world to appear. That almost-imperceptible leaning is the work of
            Aleph.
