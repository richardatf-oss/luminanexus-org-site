          <p>
            In the beginning of this book, there is no tree. No branches, no
            leaves glistening with dew, no roots tunneling into dark soil.
            There is only One: הָאֵין סוֹף, the endless, the field before every
            field. The Torah begins, “In the beginning God created the heavens
            and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), but before even that first pasuk,
            the sages speak of Ein Sof—an infinity too simple to be pictured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern physics stumbles toward this in its own language, speaking
            of unified fields and vacuum states. Kabbalah speaks of Ein Sof as
            a life so whole that “inside” and “outside” have not yet been
            imagined. Sefer Yetzirah 1:1 hints that the world is engraved
            through “thirty-two paths of wisdom,” ten sefirot and twenty-two
            letters; this Sefer asks what happens if we read those paths
            alongside the language of quantum fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Sefer is not a physics textbook and not a technical
            kabbalistic manual. It is a guided walk through the hunch that
            both are circling: that reality is one living Field which knows how
            to appear as many.

          <h2>Chapter Aleph — The First Shimmer of Existence</h2>
          <p>
            Aleph as the first almost-sound: the space that lets words be
            spoken. The chapter unfolds Aleph in three faces.

            <h3>Aleph as Field</h3>
            <p>
              Aleph as the white fire behind the letters: Ein Sof as an
              unbroken, ever-present field in which all phenomena arise.
              Classical commentators on Genesis 1:1 and Zohar 1:15a wrestle
              with what it means for creation to emerge from such hidden
              fullness. In parallel, quantum field theory describes a “vacuum”
              that is never truly empty.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Aleph as Tilt</h3>
            <p>
              The first inclination within the Field: tzimtzum as a contemplative
              picture of symmetry breaking, a subtle leaning that allows
              distinction without severance. Just as the field chooses a
              particular configuration, so the liturgy in Berakhot 2a imagines
              the Shema as the moment a person leans the heart toward the
              oneness of God.
            </p>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Aleph as Bridge</h3>
            <p>
              The written form of Aleph as upper point, lower point, and
              diagonal: keter and malchut in conversation, direct and returning
              light, the way the Infinite and the finite speak through each
              other in every moment. As the Mekubalim read verses like
              Deuteronomy 4:39 and the Shema in Deuteronomy 6:4, the letter
              Aleph becomes a diagram of heaven and earth held together.
            </p>

        <article class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
          <h3>Excerpt from Chapter Aleph</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine absolute darkness—not the darkness of a room where a switch
            could be flipped, but a darkness in which “light” and “dark” have
            never yet been conceived. No up, no down, no before or after. Only a
            fullness so complete that there is no edge to mark it. If such a
            fullness could have an inner gesture, the sages call it
            <em>ratzon</em>: will, not from lack but from overflowing. The
            Midrash on Genesis 1:1 and passages in Zohar 1:15a speak of this
            overflowing as the desire to be known.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this will, a first tilt arises. The Infinite does not move
            from here to there; rather, it allows a tiny asymmetry, a place for
            a world to appear. In the language of prayer, this is the heart
            preparing to say the Shema of Berakhot 2a. In the language of
            physics, it is the moment a symmetric field quietly breaks
            symmetry. That almost-imperceptible leaning is the work of Aleph.
