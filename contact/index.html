              LuminaNexus.org is a small nexus of work growing from one living
              Tree of Life: <em>Etz Chaim</em>. If this vision of fields, sefirot,
              and sefarim-as-branches speaks to you, there are many ways to join
              the canopy.

          <p class="section-intro">
            In the language of the Etz Chaim, every person is like a branch that
            can carry light further. These are three simple paths: tending the
            roots, growing new branches, and nourishing the fruit.
          </p>

            <article class="card">
              <h3>Guard the roots</h3>
              <p>
                Use the Library, learn with ChavrutaGPT, and explore the Trees
                of Origin, Stone, Mirrors, Snow, Water, Fire, and Song. Share
                questions, corrections, and insights that help keep the roots
                honest and alive.
              </p>
              <p class="card-meta">
                Roots are Torah, tradition, and sources. Guarding them means
                learning with care.

              <h3>Grow new branches</h3>
              <p>
                Writers, rabbanim, educators, coders, artists, and curious souls
                are welcome. If you feel called to help shape a particular Tree
                or Sefer, reach out about collaboration, co-writing, or building
                new tools under the canopy.
              </p>
              <p class="card-meta">
                Branches are projects: apps, sefarim, stories, and sanctuaries
                that extend the Tree outward.

              <h3>Nourish the fruit</h3>
              <p>
                As the nonprofit formalizes, there will be ways to sponsor
                specific Sefarim, scholarships, or experimental tools that make
                learning feel like standing in a living orchard of light. For
                now, the best support is encouragement, feedback, and
                connection.

              <p class="card-meta">
                Fruit is what reaches real people: learners, families, and
                communities who taste these ideas.

                As the work grows, this section can host simple intake forms for
                things like ChavrutaGPT pilots, Ivrit HaOr learners, or specific
                Trees (Stone, Mirrors, Snow, etc.). For now, writing directly is
                the best way to begin.
